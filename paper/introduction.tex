\section*{Introduction}
Benchmark problems are important for validation and comparison of implementations of 
computational codes. They also play important role in comparison of different numerical methods. They provide reference
values which are believed to be very close to actual solution of given problems. 
This particular benchmark serves for Fluid-Structure Interaction problems and it describes
a flow around cylinder with an elastic flap attached, see Figure .....
The geometry is based on the standard flow around cylinder benchmark from
\cite{TurekSchaefer1996}. The layout of our paper is like that, in the first section we describe 
the Turek\&Hron benchmark and in the following one we present some of our results.
