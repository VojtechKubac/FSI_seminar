  The purpose of this paper is to discuss widely used benchmark for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI). 
  This benchmark was benchmark was introduced by Turek and Hron in \cite{TurekHron2006a} and 
  we will refere to it as Turek\&Hron benchmark. It consists of validations
  of pure elastic solid solver and pure fluid solver, followed by validation of the whole FSI problem.
  As a continuation of the fist paper can be seen \cite{TurekHronRazzaqSchaefer2010} where 
  results obtained by different apporaches from different researcher groupes are presented.
