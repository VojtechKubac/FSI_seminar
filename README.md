# FSI_seminar

This is a repository with my computations for FSI seminar at TUM. It's about Turek&Hron FSI benchmark[1],
for which I wrote solid solver, validated in the directory *CSM_benchmark*. Then, in the directory
*FSI*, FSI benchmarks are computed. The FSI comptetions are done by partitioned approach with the use
of *preCICE* software [2]. The OpenFOAM fluid solver is taken from preCICE tutorial repository.
